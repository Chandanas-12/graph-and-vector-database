1. Integration Framework Analysis
------------------------------
Q: What are the phases of the integration framework that were discussed?
A: The phases of the integration framework that were explicitly discussed include the second phase, which focuses on defining input, output, and core functionalities such as creating, deleting, and updating folders, and the third phase, which involves the agent managing meeting notes by creating, reading, and deleting them. Other phases were mentioned but not specifically discussed.

2. System Design Analysis
------------------------------
Q: What was discussed about the system design and who is responsible for it?
A: The system design was discussed twice during the meeting. First, Chandana's team interpreted the task as creating a system design for the entire project, which resulted in a flowchart that includes user actions and data management, rather than focusing solely on the database integration. Later, Sandesh presented a detailed design for the project, including a user-agent interaction model and a feedback loop for gathering requirements. It appears that Chandana's team and Sandesh are responsible for the system design.
